            <p class="historyText" ><b>The name Medellin is of Spanish origin and refers to the village with 
                the same name in the Badajoz province of Extremadura in Spain. Medellin became a municipality
                by royal decree of Queen Isabel II of Spain on September 9, 1881. <br><br>
                Medellin was formerly part of Daanbantayan. As a town, it started with only 3 barangays, 
                namely; Kawit and Buenavista on the west coast, and Tindog on the east coast. Kawit, being 
                the biggest and most progressive barangay at that time, became the first seat of government. <br><br>
                Due to its deep shore water, the area was prone to pirates. As a consequence, the seat of 
                government was then transferred to Buenavista (Daanlungsod). However, in view of its shallow
                shore water, traders and merchants found it difficult to transport their wares to and from 
                Buenavista. A distance away south of Buenavista, there was a place called Tawagan which was 
                an ideal site for trade and commerce. When the seat of government was transferred to Tawagan,
                the new poblacion was then called Medellin.</b><br></p>
